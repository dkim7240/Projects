- My solution to the problem is consisted of three header files and two source files.
  
  Header files: Astar.h, Node.h, PQueue.h
  Source files: Astar.cpp, Main.cpp

  Astar.h: Contains definitions of the methods of the interface for A* module. 
  Node.h: Contains the definition of the node 
  PQueue.h: Contains the definitions and implementations of the priority queue
            for the frontier of A*
  
  Astar.cpp: Contains the implementations of the declared methods in Astar.h
  Main.cpp: The main controller of the program
  
- I implemented the A* algorithm as described in pseudocode in the lecture
  for this problem.
