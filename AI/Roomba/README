- My solution to the problem is consisted of three files.
  
  Nodes.h: Contains the definitions and implementations of 
           different types of nodes of behavior tree
  BehaviorTree.h: Contains the definitions of methods necessary for
                  initializing the behavior tree for Roomba as instructed
				  in the specification sheet
  BehaviorTree.cpp: Contains the implementations of the methods declared
                    in BehaviorTree.h  
  Blackboard.h: Contains the definition of a Blackboard object
  main.cpp : The main controller of the program which manages input and output  
   
- I implemented the behavior tree as shown in the problem set and 
  mostly followed the design patterns described in the lecture.
