- My solution to the problem is consisted of three files.
	ANN.h, ANN.cpp, NeuralNetworks.cpp
	
	* ANN.h contains the member functions and properties of the neural network object.
	* ANN.cpp contains the implementations of each member function.
	* NeuralNetworks.cpp contains the main() which controls the flow of the program.
	
	* The input text file should be in the same directory as where the files listed above
	  are located.
	  
- The accuracy of my model usually varies from 0.6 to 0.9. 	
- I implemented the ANN following the design patterns described in the lecture.
