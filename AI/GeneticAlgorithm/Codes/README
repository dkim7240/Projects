- My solution to the problem is consisted of one source file.
  
  Pset2.cpp: Includes the implementations of chromosome generator,
             fitness function, fringe operations, and printing out
			 the solution.
  
- I implemented the genetic algorithm as described in pseudocode 
  in the lecture for this problem.
